# Building Useless Tests

What I've done:
1. Wrote a functional test using Selenium
2. Expanded our functional test to include comments that describe the task we're setting ourselves, our minimum viable to-do list. We've also rewritten it to use the Python `unittest` module and its various testing helper functions

What I've learned:
- Functional test is the same as acceptance test is the same as end-to-end test
  - look at how the application functions from the interface perspective not knowing what is going on
